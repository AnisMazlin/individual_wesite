	<b><font color="#800080"><p> My first time watching movie at cinema was when I studied at Kolej Matrikulasi Melaka. I went to GSC Cinema Dataran Pahlawan.</p></font></b>

	<b><font color="#800080"><p>I watched movie named "Skyscraper" with my other three roommates. It was a great first-time experience which I wish will happen again sooner or later.</p></font></b>

	<b><font color="#800080"><p> My first waterpark I went when I was younger is at Wet World Air Panas Pedas Resort in Negeri Sembilan. </p></font></b>

	<b><font color="#800080"><p>I was brought by my youngest auntie and she treated all her nieces and nephews since it was our first outing together.</p></font></b>
	<b><font color="#800080"><p> My another first time which I will not forget for the rest of my life was when I went to watch a football match in Kota Bharu.</p></font></b>
	<img src="images/stadium.jpg" height="200px" width="200px">
	<b><font color="#800080"><p> The match was between Kelantan FA and Kedah FA. I was so happy because I got to see my favourite football player and thankfully they won the match.</p></font></b>
	<b><font color="#800080"><p> I still have the entrance ticket to enter the stadium in my storage box.</p></font></b>
